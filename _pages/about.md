I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in Professor [Chunsheng Wangâ€™s group](https://cswang.umd.edu/) at the University of Maryland. Prior to joining the University of Maryland, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher in the School of Chemical and Biological Engineering at Seoul National University, supervised by Professor [Jang Wook Choi](https://mest.snu.ac.kr/). I received my Ph.D. and B.S. degrees in Energy Engineering from Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST), advised by Professor [Jaephil Cho](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GN3C9q4AAAAJ&hl=ko).

My research began with a deep understanding of silicon (Si) anodes, particularly through the development of bottom-up Si materials using chemical vapor deposition (CVD) techniques. Since then, I have worked extensively on advancing Si anode technologies across multiple domains, including surface coatings, pre-lithiation strategies, electrolyte design, and all-solid-state batteries. In addition to Si anodes, I have also developed broad expertise in battery systems involving, such as lithium metal, sulfur cathodes, and high-nickel layered oxide cathodes.
